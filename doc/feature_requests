13:40 < ab> telmich, kinda. I was more thinking of a list of things that are free now, how long they are 
            free for, with an easy way to click and get a booking of one immediately
13:41 < ab> ie. the use case is I want a machine now, I see a list of whatever's available now and for 
            how long it's available, and I can click on one of them to choose it, which takes me to a 
            pre-filled booking form where all I have to specify is the end time/date of the reservation
13:41 < ab> I'm thinking that's the use model most people have for short-term machine reservations, so 
            it's worth making that process really painless to encourage use of the system
13:41 < ab> otherwise the easiest usage model is the same: reserve something long-term in case I need 
            it, so that when I do I don't have to interact with the booking system
