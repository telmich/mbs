- do not remove bookings, but invalidate them (and record who did that)
- only authenticate once, keep the authentication during the session?
- only allow bookings to usable machines  => Use the usable flag
- Setup correct booking Time (should be Now, not 2200)
- Change many machines (usable) => maintenance
- Deploy to sgv-rails-02 (from scratch!)
- Add General purpose machines
- document deployment (rvm installation etc). => blog/docs
- redirect to error message, if ldap-server is not reachable
