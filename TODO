- only allow bookings to usable machines  => Use the usable flag
   - add general purpose flag?
   - or type? machine_booking_type = { maintenance, bookable, general purpose }
- Change many machines (usable) => maintenance
- Deploy to sgv-rails-02 (from scratch!)
- Add General purpose machines (how?)
- document deployment (rvm installation etc). => blog/docs
- redirect to error message, if ldap-server is not reachablk
- Only display active bookings
   - 2nd step: Add date range to select bookings
