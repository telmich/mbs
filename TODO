/ Do not remove bookings, but invalidate them (and record who did that)
   - BROKEN: we do not submit nodes_count on delete
      - probably remove nodes_count as it's broken?
         - fail if zero machine booking (sum up?)
         - map to model!
      - probably use $whatever to setup booking.reservations array and test that?

- only allow bookings to usable machines  => Use the usable flag
   - add general purpose flag?
   - or type?
      machine_booking_type = { maintenance, bookable, general purpose }
         - 1:n to machine!
   - Add General purpose machines (how?)
- Change many machines (usable) => maintenance
- Deploy to sgv-rails-02 (from scratch!)
   - document deployment (rvm installation etc). => blog/docs
- Only display active bookings
   - 2nd step: Add date range to select bookings
